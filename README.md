# Required Packages:
```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers
                  ## or
yarn add @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers

npm install react-hot-toast
          ## or
yarn add react-hot-toast

npm install react-loading
        ## or
yarn add react-loading
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn instll

# and Now:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
